# Using RAMP for generating load courves for remote communities in Bolivia

## Description
This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources for implementing a high-resolution multi-energy load profile generation model tailored for the unique energy consumption patterns observed in Bolivia.

## Overview
RAMP is an open-source software suite for the stochastic simulation of any user-driven energy demand time series based on few simple inputs.
This stochastic model aims to generate high-resolution multi-energy load profiles for remote areas in Bolivia. It utilizes advanced algorithms to simulate energy consumption behaviors, considering various factors such as user classes, appliance usage patterns, and environmental conditions specific to the region.
